        <p>When shopping for budget mics, you'll constantly encounter two words: <strong>Condenser</strong> and <strong>Dynamic</strong>. Understanding the difference will save you from making a huge purchasing mistake.</p>
        <h2>Condenser Microphones</h2>
        <p>Almost all USB microphones under $50 (like the <a href="behringer-c1u.html" style="color:var(--accent)">Behringer C-1U</a>) are Condensers. Condenser mics are extremely sensitive and capture highly detailed, bright, and nuanced audio. They are perfect for quiet, carpeted, sound-treated rooms. <strong>Warning:</strong> Because they are so sensitive, they will pick up your mechanical keyboard, your PC fan, and the dog barking next door.</p>
        <h2>Dynamic Microphones</h2>
        <p>Dynamic microphones operate on electromagnetism. They are much less sensitive but are renowned for their incredible <em>background noise rejection</em>. If you stream in a noisy house, a dynamic mic is a lifesaver. However, they are rare to find with USB connections under $50, and usually require expensive audio interfaces to power them properly.</p>
        <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> On a strict budget under $50, stick to Condenser USB mics, but invest time in learning how to use software noise gates!</p>
